        <p>{% trans "I am Marcello Antony, currently working as a QA Engineer at BRB (Banco de Brasília) in Brazil, specifically within the NUTEB (Núcleo de Testes em Baixa Plataforma). My expertise lies in web testing, utilizing tools such as Selenium, Cypress, and frameworks like Robot, alongside programming languages like C and Python. In addition to my strong technical foundation, I bring a unique perspective as an individual with autism. This characteristic enhances my ability to concentrate, be creative, and remain dedicated, leading to consistent and impactful achievements. I excel in both collaborative team environments and when working independently. My professional philosophy is centered around the core values of inclusion and diversity, which I believe are essential in any workplace. I am committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all team members. Driven by a passion for challenges and a continuous desire for learning, I am a proactive professional eager to explore new growth opportunities. I am confident in my ability to make a significant contribution to any team and am enthusiastic about advancing my field through meaningful work." %}</p>
